# Pi(π) Billion Digits Segment 1

This repository contains the **Pi(π) Billion Digits Segment 1** as a continuous sequence starting with the digit "3"  
It serves multiple purposes, including:

1. **Showcasing My Data Handling Abilities:** Demonstrating how vast datasets can be efficiently managed and distributed.  
2. **Highlighting GitHub's Capabilities:** Proving GitHub's ability to store and share large datasets.  
3. **Supporting Rational Thinkers:** Providing non-pattern digits for mathematical, philosophical, and rational exploration.  
4. **Helping Artists:** Inspiring creativity by making pi's infinite beauty freely available for artistic use.

## File Structure
The digits of π are organized hierarchically in directories for easy navigation. The structure is as follows:

- ** data/0/0/1000.txt **: Contains the first thousand digits, starting at the 0th billion and 0th million.  
- ** data/0/1/1000.txt **: Contains the next thousand digits, starting at the 0th billion and 1st million.  
- ** data/1/0/1000.txt **: Contains digits from the 1st billion and 0th million onward.  


### Hierarchy Explanation
- **First Directory ('data/{billion}'):** Represents the billion range.  
  - Example: '0' for 0-1 billion, '1' for 1-2 billion.  
- **Second Directory ('data/{billion}/{million}'):** Represents the million range within the billion.  
  - Example: '0' for 0-1 million, '1' for 1-2 million.  
- **Filename ('1000.txt'):** Each file contains 1,000 digits starting from its specified range.  


This hierarchical structure allows efficient navigation and storage of digits across large ranges.


## Why Use This Dataset?
- **Mathematics Research:** Explore π's infinite, non-repeating properties.  
- **Programming Challenges:** Test algorithms with a massive dataset.  
- **Artistic Expression:** Use the digits of π as a source of inspiration.  
- **Rational Thinking:** Dive deep into the fascinating irrationality of π.
